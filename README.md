# **Machine Learning Template**

## **Project Overview**
This project serves as a **template for Machine Learning projects**, providing a structured framework for implementing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. The goal is to streamline the development of machine learning solutions by offering reusable components and well-documented workflows. The implementation showcases advanced algorithms like **XGBoost**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Gaussian Naive Bayes** for classification tasks.

## **Features and Objectives**
